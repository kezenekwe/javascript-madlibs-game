<h2>A Letter From George</h2>
<h4>Follow the instructions to fill in the blanks with a word of your choice.</h4>
<p>Hello, my fellow <span id="wordone"></span> in 2020, its me, George Washington, the first <span id="wordtwo"></span>. I am writing from <span id="wordthree"></span>,
where I have been secretely living for the past <span id="wordfour"></span> years. I am concerned by the <span id="wordfive"></span> state of affairs in America these days.
It seems that your politicians are more concerned with <span id="wordsix"></span> one another than with listening to the <span id="wordseven"></span> of the people. When we 
declared our independence from <span id="wordeight"></span>, we set forth on a/an <span id="wordnine"></span> path guided by the voices of the everyday <span id="wordten"></span>. 
If we're going to keep <span id="wordeleven"></span>, then we need to learn how to respect all <span id="wordtwelve"></span>. Don't get me wrong; we had <span id="wordthirteen"></span>
problems in my day, too. Benjamin Franklin once called me a/an <span id="wordfourteen"></span> and kicked me in the <span id="wordfifteen"></span>. But at the end of the day, 
we were able to <span id="wordsixteen"></span> in harmony. Let us find that <span id="wordseventeen"></span> spirit once again, or else I'm taking my <span id="wordeighteen"></span>
off the quarter!</p>
